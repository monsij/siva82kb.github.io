    "I recently was involved in a discussion on linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, in particular a LTI filter that someone was trying to characterize. Their plan was to use a sinc pulse as an input and then find out the Fourier spectrum of the filter's output to obtain the filter's frequency response. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I heard this, it sounded like a strange idea but after a few moments of thinking about it, it was seemed alright. I had never thought about characterizing a filter using a sinc pulse before. You often come across the sinc function in so many different contexts in linear systems theory, linear transforms, and sampling theory, but I had never before seen it as an input to characterize the frequency response of a LTI system."
