    <p>I currently offer graduate courses in linear algebra, probability & statistics, and linear systems theory. I am also currently working on a course on neuromechnaics, extending a course on movement mechanics I had offered in Spring 2016. My hope is that a version of this neuromechanics course could be offered to students pursuing physical and occupational therapy.</p>
